# CodeMapper

This project will soon be an NPM package to make use simple and easy!

For now, to use this repo as it is, download everything and run "npm start" in the command line. A small application will run that will ask for the root path to the project you'd like to analyze. This means the codebase you're analyzing needs to be available on your local machine!

Once you point CodeMapper to the right place, you'll be able to select which files and folders at the root level of the project you'd like to include for analyzing.

Once that's done, open up the index.html file in the newly generated CodeMapper/Visualization folder in your browser. You'll see a page with a two buttons leading to different visualizations with more details about your project.

P.S. CodeMapper shines most when looking at JavaScript-heavy projects, as we're able to give more details about JavaScript files.
